# pokeRandom
A small web app randomizer made with the purpose of simulating a gameplay challenge in certain Pokemon games called the "Battle Factory"

The app lets you pick the number of users participating and allows you to randomize a selected pool of pokemon equally between all the users. This app can also be used in settings outside Pokemon. One example is if the user needs to make teams for a sporting event. They can enter the number of teams and the pool of available players and randomize the players to a team.
